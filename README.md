# ColorSpring

> Named CSS Color Tool - CSS defines a large set of “named colors” that can be used in place of hex or RGB values. 16 of these named colours are originally from HTML: aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray, green, lime, maroon, navy, olive, purple, red, silver, teal, white, & yellow. The rest mainly derive from the X11 color system, used in Unix derived systems.
